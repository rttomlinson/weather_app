ToDo, figure out how to get the Request to wait until we get coordinates back. <---Organize this


Concepts covered, CORS, JSONP, CORS with Proxy server. Currently using a proxy server or CORS request because No "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header is present. I guess the Dark Sky servers didn't add it? Or my Origin Header wasn't added. HTTPS and "non-secured" . Events and Event Handlers. XMLHttpRequests in vanilla Javascript and jQuery.

Currently using inline svg. May considering moving to an external file.
