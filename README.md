# weather_app

[Working demo hosted on Heroku](https://minimal-weather-app.herokuapp.com/)

If copying these files, you will need to acquire an API key from Dark Sky and create a directory 'keys' in the root directory with 
a json file named darkSkyKey and have your API key the value of a property named "darkSkyKey".
Example:
{
    "darkSkyKey": "[Your key here]"
}


Currently using inline svg. May considering moving to an external file.
