# weather_app

[Working demo hosted on Heroku](https://minimal-weather-app.herokuapp.com/)

If copying these files, you will need to acquire an API key from Dark Sky and set an environment variable to DARK_SKY_API_KEY.
The weather.js in the /routes directory relies on this variable being set to send it's request to the Dark Sky API.


Currently using inline svg. May considering moving to an external file.
